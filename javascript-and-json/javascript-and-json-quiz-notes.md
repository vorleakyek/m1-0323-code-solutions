After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSON?
A: JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax.

A: Serialization is the process of turning an object in memory into a stream of bytes so you can do stuff like store it on disk or send it over the network.

Deserialization is the reverse process: turning a stream of bytes into an object in memory.
