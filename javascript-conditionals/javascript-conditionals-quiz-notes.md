- What is the purpose of an `if` statement?

- How do you compare two different expressions in the same condition?

- What is the purpose of a `switch` statement?
A: The switch statement is used to test the equality of a variable against several values specified in the test cases.

The switch statement evaluates an expression, matching the expression's value against a series of case clauses, and executes statements after the first case clause with a matching value, until a break statement is encountered. The default clause of a switch statement will be jumped to if no case matches the expression's value.

- Is a `default` clause required in order to use a `switch` statement?
A: The  `default` clause is optional.

A default clause; if provided, this clause is executed if the value of expression doesn't match any of the case clauses. A switch statement can only have one default clause.
