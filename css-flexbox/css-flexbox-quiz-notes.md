## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the default `flex-direction` of a `flex` container?
A: The default flex-direction of a flex container is row, so the items should appear in a horizontal row automatically.

- What is the default `flex-wrap` of a `flex` container?
A: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line.
nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line

- What axis do the `justify-content` properties work on?
A: This defines the alignment along the main axis.
So, if the flex-direction is row, then the main axis is horrizontally.
If the flex-direction is column, then the main axis is vertially.

- What axis do the `align-items` properties work on?
A: This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
