## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- How do block-level elements affect the document flow?
A: block-level elements begin on new lines

Content model
Generally, block-level elements may contain inline elements and (sometimes) other block-level elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline elements.

- How do inline elements affect the document flow?
A: inline elements can start anywhere in a line

Content model
Generally, inline elements may contain only data and other inline elements.

- What are the default width and height of a block-level element?
A: takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Note:
Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

- What are the default width and height of an inline element?
A: only takes up as much width as necessary

Note:
Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.
