## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

Note:
Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application. Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage (see Sending form data later in the module), or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way (for example, add another item to a list, or show or hide a UI feature).

<input>
<textarea>
<label>
<fieldset>
