## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
A: It refers to a specific screen width at which the layout of a webpage is adjusted to make the page looks better on smaller/larger devices.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
A: It makes the layout more flexible since it changes the width based on the total available width.

Note:
 Percentage widths allow the columns to fluidly adjust and adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This ensures that the layout remains responsive and can accommodate various devices, from large desktop screens to smaller mobile screens. The columns will automatically resize based on the available width

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
A: Because the later rule specified in the CSS will have a higher specificity and thus will override the previous rule set.
