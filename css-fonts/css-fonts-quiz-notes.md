## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Name two types of units that can be used to adjust `font-size` in CSS.
A: px, em, and rem

Notes:

px (pixels): The number of pixels high you want the text to be. This is an absolute unit â€” it results in the same final computed value for the font on the page in pretty much any situation.

1 em is equal to the font size set on the parent element of the current element we are styling (more specifically, the width of a capital letter M contained inside the parent element).

1 rem is equal to the font size set on the root element of the document (i.e. <html>), not the parent element.

- What CSS property controls the font used for the text inside an element?
A: font-family

The font-family property lists one or more font families, separated by commas. Each font family is specified as either a <family-name> or a <generic-name> value.
