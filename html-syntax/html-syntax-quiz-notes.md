## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Give five examples of HTML element types.
A:
paragraph <p>
head <h1> to <h6>
form <form>
table <table>
lists <ul> and <li>

- What is the purpose of HTML attributes?
A: to target that specific element for applying a certain CSS style

Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the class attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.

- Give an example of an HTML entity (escape character).
A: greater than (&gt;)

Notes:
o An escape character is an alternative version of a symbol. In HTML, there are some characters that are considered reserved (such as less than (<) and greater than (>) signs, which also signify tags) and must be replaced by using the characterâ€™s HTML code name or number, so that the character will be read as a regular character and not a reserved HTML character.

o Escape characters will always begin with the ampersand symbol (&) and end with a semicolon symbol (;). The characters in between the ampersand and semicolon make up the specific code name or number for a particular character.

o The specific code name is the entity name and the code number is the entity number. The entity name and entity number are synonymous in most cases, but some browsers may not support all entity names
